Moving Horizon Estimation for Economic Predictive Control.

The MATLAB code attached reveals how the observer designed gives the best current state estimation in an economic context with gradient information obtained from economic objective function and the optimal future input.

The view of sensitivity or gradient more specifically, is tested on a numberical systems which can be denoted as (A_s, B_s, C_s, D_s) in the code.
